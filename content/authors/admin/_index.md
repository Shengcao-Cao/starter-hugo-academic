Welcome!

I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Liangy-Yan Gui](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/lgui) & [Yu-iong Wang](https://yxw.web.illinois.edu/). Previously, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with MS in Robotics, where I was advised by [Kris Kitani](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kkitani/), and Peking University with BS in Computer Science, where I was advised by [Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/).

I mainly study the intersection of machine learning and computer vision, in particular developing self-supervised approaches to object-level visual recognition. In addition to this data-efficient perspective, I also explore the computation efficiency of neural networks by network compression and neural architecture search.

I am looking for research internships for Summer 2024. Feel free to contact me if interested!
