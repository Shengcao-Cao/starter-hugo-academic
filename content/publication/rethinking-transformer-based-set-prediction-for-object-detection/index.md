abstract: "DETR is a recently proposed Transformer-based method which views
  object detection as a set prediction problem and achieves state-of-the-art
  performance but demands extra-long training time to converge. In this paper,
  we investigate the causes of the optimization difficulty in the training of
  DETR. Our examinations reveal several factors contributing to the slow
  convergence of DETR, primarily the issues with the Hungarian loss and the
  Transformer cross attention mechanism. To overcome these issues we propose two
  solutions, namely, TSP-FCOS (Transformer-based Set Prediction with FCOS) and
  TSP-RCNN (Transformer-based Set Prediction with RCNN). Experimental results
  show that the proposed methods not only converge much faster than the original
  DETR, but also significantly outperform DETR and other baselines in terms of
  detection accuracy. "
